 DATA pipeline flow in AWS.

-Data Ingestion:
Raw data from various sources, such as databases or logs is ingested into Amazon S3.
This can be achieved using AWS Glue or custom data ingestion scripts.


-Data Preparation:
AWS Glue Crawlers automatically discover the schema and catalog metadata about the ingested data.
AWS Glue DataBrew provides a visual interface for data preparation tasks, including data cleaning, transformation, and enrichment.

-Data Transformation:
Data transformation is performed using AWS Glue ETL Jobs or AWS Lambda functions.
These services allow for transforming the data according to specific business requirements, 
such as data cleansing, aggregation, filtering, or joining different datasets.

-Data Storage:
Transformed data can be stored in a data warehouse like Amazon Redshift for further analysis.
Alternatively, data can be stored in an optimized format within Amazon S3 for data lake architectures.

-Data Processing and Analysis:
Amazon EMR clusters can be provisioned to process large volumes of data using Apache Spark or Hadoop.
AWS Glue ETL Jobs can also be utilized for data processing tasks.
SQL queries can be executed on services like Amazon Redshift or Amazon Athena for data analysis.

-Workflow Orchestration:
AWS Step Functions is used to orchestrate the data pipeline.
It enables the coordination of different steps and services, defining complex workflows, handling retries, and monitoring pipeline progress.

-Data Visualization and Reporting:
Analyzed data can be visualized using tools such as Amazon QuickSight, Tableau, or custom dashboards built on AWS services.
Reports and insights are generated based on the analysis to facilitate decision-making processes.
