problem statement https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-report/problem?isFullScreen=true
Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark. Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically. Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.
Write a query to help Eve.
Query:
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN Grades.Grade >= 8 THEN Students.Name
        ELSE 'NULL'
    END AS Name,
    Grades.Grade,
    Students.Marks
FROM
    Students
JOIN
    Grades ON Students.Marks BETWEEN Grades.Min_Mark AND Grades.Max_Mark
ORDER BY
    Grades.Grade DESC,
    Name ASC,
    Students.Marks ASC;
